One of the few changes to refactor the code is by clasifying each CRUD function and renaming it one by one for example
the post function will be named as updateBook function
and then it will be exported out through module.exports() so that it can be used in app.js since the functions are in a seperate folders.

There were times where i forgot to export out the function even though i have finished it and there were times where i only completed the function in
one of the folders like controllers but then i haven't pasted it into the models folder.

The MVC structure is more forgiving as if i write all the functions in a single file, and one specific function fails, it doesn't crash the file itself
as it provides fault isolation.

The readability of code is much easier as in app.js there might be hundreds of lines of code but in MVC code is broken down to smaller files with
specific names.

Its easier to see where mistakes happen, for example if a user query fails I know there is an issue in Model, while if there is an issue while
the controller handles data then there is an issue in Controller.
